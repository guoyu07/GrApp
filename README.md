About the application
=====================

This **Spring Boot application** is based on the [Neo4j Movies Demo App](https://github.com/neo4j-examples/movies-java-spring-data-neo4j)

It is using a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database that was created based on data found in the (large!) Consumer Complaint Database.

This is available here for download (*.csv* format) [here](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints).

Please refer to the [help/neo4j-commands.cyp](help/neo4j-commands.cyp) script to see how the Neo4j database has been created from this *.csv* file.

You might also consider watching the following [tutorial](https://neo4j.com/developer/guide-import-csv) (very useful!).
